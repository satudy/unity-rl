# Collaboration and Competition
## 1. Introduction
In this environment, two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. If an agent hits the ball over the net, it receives a reward of +0.1. If an agent lets a ball hit the ground or hits the ball out of bounds, it receives a reward of -0.01. Thus, the goal of each agent is to keep the ball in play.

The observation space consists of 8 variables corresponding to the position and velocity of the ball and racket. Each agent receives its own, local observation. Two continuous actions are available, corresponding to movement toward (or away from) the net, and jumping.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agents must get an average score of +0.5 (over 100 consecutive episodes, after taking the maximum over both agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 2 (potentially different) scores. We then take the maximum of these 2 scores.
- This yields a single score for each episode.
- State Space: Continuous.
- Action Space: Continuous.
- Tha agent goal:The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those scores is at least +0.5.

## 2. Solution
We use DDPG to train the two agent simultaneously.
the code of DDPG and its agent is in 'network/DDPG_PyTorch.py' 

## 3. Getting Started
Running environment.
#### 1. Python
> The python version is 3.6
#### 2. UnityEnvironment
>```text
>$pip install mlagents==0.4
>```
#### 3. GPU-Environment:
> 
>CUDA 9.0
>
#### 4. Pytorch-GPU
>torch-1.0.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64 
>```text
>$pip3 install https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu90/torch-1.0.0-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl
>$pip3 install torchvision
>```

## 4. How to execute.
You can execute the agent_pytorch.py.
Change the parameter "train" in agent_pytorch.py to False to skip the training process and load the available weight in 
result/tennis_pytorch directory.
